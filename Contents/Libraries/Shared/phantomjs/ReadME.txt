Drop your PhantomJS http://phantomjs.org/download.html binary file here.

Currently only tested on Windows.

Note: The PhantomJS response time to retrieve the final url can be more than 20 sec. So any Plex client like Plex-web that has a time-out of 20 sec. or less will throw a generic Channel error.
